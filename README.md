## 🌟 What is Nourivo?

**Nourivo** is a social impact platform that transforms *your daily steps into meals for those in need.*  
With every **10,000 steps**, you trigger the donation of a **meal** to someone who needs it — all without spending a rupee.

It’s powered by you, monitored by volunteers, and executed through verified NGOs.

> ✨ _Your walk can feed a soul. Literally._ ✨

---

## 💡 Why is Nourivo Needed?

Millions of people walk every day. And millions more go hungry.

- **Urban youth** are more health-conscious than ever, tracking their steps, workouts, and fitness daily.
- **NGOs** face difficulty in consistently securing donations and volunteers.
- **Volunteers** often want to help but don’t know *how*, *when*, or *where*.

💥 Nourivo bridges that gap:

- It lets people **gamify their steps** for a cause.
- It enables NGOs to **receive instant triggers** for donations.
- It rewards volunteers with **badges**, purpose, and pride.

---

## 🛠 How it Works

1. **Track Steps:**  
   Volunteers walk with their phone or fitness tracker. Once they reach **10,000 steps**, Nourivo recognizes it.

2. **Trigger Donation:**  
   Behind the scenes, a request is sent to a partnered **NGO** to deliver one meal to a nearby location.

3. **Badge System:**  
   Volunteers unlock **milestone badges** at 10, 30, 50, 75, and 100 meals donated. Keep walking, keep unlocking.

4. **NGO Dashboard:**  
   NGOs can log in to see:
   - Number of meals received
   - Nearby volunteers
   - Last donation time

5. **Volunteer Dashboard:**  
   Volunteers can see:
   - Steps today
   - Total steps walked
   - Meals donated
   - Badges earned
